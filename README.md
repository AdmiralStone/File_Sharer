# P2P File Sharing System

A peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing system built in C++ to learn advanced concepts like multithreading, smart pointers, templates, file handling, and more. The project starts with a command-line interface (CLI) and will eventually include a graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features
- Peer discovery and connection
- File sharing (uploading and downloading)
- Multithreading file transfer
- Error handling and logging
- Command-line interface (CLI) with plans for a GUI

## Project Structure
- `src/`: Source code files
- `include/`: Header files
- `bin/`: Compiled binaries
- `logs/`: Log files for debugging and tracking
- `docs/`: Documentation files
